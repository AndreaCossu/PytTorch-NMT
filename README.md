# PytTorch-NMT
Neural Machine Translation inspired by https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/seq2seq-translation/seq2seq-translation.ipynb

Translation is from English to Italian and it uses Anki-Tatoeba dataset (http://www.manythings.org/anki/), which has been randomized and split in train, validation and test.
